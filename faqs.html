          <p class="question">Do I need to speak German?</p>
          <p class="answer">You do not, but the better you speak, the more you will get from your experience. All BOA instruction is conducted in English. German language classes are an integral part of the BOA experience. This will best prepare you for audition tours in Germany. Berlin is very friendly to international visitors and most signs are in English. Most Germans in Berlin also speak English fluently.</p>

          <p class="question">Are operas performed with orchestra?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes, all operas will be performed with chamber orchestra.</p>

          <p class="question">Is there an age limit to apply?</p>
          <p class="answer">BOA participants are typically between the ages of 19-36, but there are no age limits. We accept musicians on the basis of potential and employability.</p>

          <p class="question">In the event that I have to cancel my participation, are my tuition installments refundable?</p>
          <p class="answer">All tuition payments are non-refundable. We strongly recommend “cancel for any reason insurance” to protect your investment. Not only can this serve to help should you need to cancel your participation, it can also reimburse your planned travel costs. “Cancel for any reason insurance” providers vary by country of residence, so ask locally for more information.</p>

          <p class="question">Are accommodation and food included in my tuition?</p>
          <p class="answer">Accommodation and food are not included in the tuition fee. Fortunately, Berlin is a very affordable city compared to other world capitals when it comes to accommodation, supermarkets and restaurants.</p>

          <p class="question">Am I ready for BOA?</p>
          <p class="answer">BOA accepts musicians at many stages of development. We do not expect 'finished products'. We have undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate applicants. We accept musicians that demonstrate developing vocal technique, positive work ethic and potential. Our primary goal is to help each in their own journey to an operatic career by giving them the necessary tools to succeed.</p>
          
          <p class="question">How many casts are there?</p>
          <p class="answer">Our operas will be triple cast. We place a high value on learning by doing, so singers are expected to be actively learning in rehearsals at all times. We coordinate rehearsals to provide singers with as much individual instruction with faculty as possible.</p>

          <p class="question">Will I get to audition for an agent?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes. Each session we bring in well known artist managers and agents of reputation and high standard. You will not only have the opportunity to present yourself, they will also give a masterclass, workshop or individualized coaching. They will explain what will best improve your chances of being hired by a company in Germany. BOA students from previous sessions have been directly offered positions and engaged by agents brought to the program.</p>

          <p class="question">Are singers ever hired as a result of agent auditions at BOA?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes. BOA connects singers each summer to agencies, which regularly results in further employment auditions. BOA Alumni have been successful in securing engagements in German-speaking houses in both solo and chorus repertoire.</p>

          <p class="question">What is the difference between being a Festival Singer and a Studio Singer?</p>
          <p class="answer">The primary difference between the two is the performance of a role. The festival includes the rehearsal and performance of a fully staged opera, whereas studio singers focus on professional and artistic development and presentation.</p>

          <p class="question">Are there dormitories?</p>
          <p class="answer">BOA has partnered with local accommodation companies to offer BOA students competitive monthly rental options for their study periods in Berlin.</p>
          <p class="question">How do I get a resident permit to study?</p>
          <p class="answer">Students registered for full-time courses at BOA, coming from a 'third country' (outside the EU), must apply for a residence permit to live in Germany. Based on the <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/englisch_aufenthg.html">Act on residence, Economic Activity and Integration of Foreigners in the Federal Territory Residence Act</a>, students may apply for a "residence permit for educational purposes" (Section 16b Par 1)  </p>
          <p class="question">Do I have the opportunity to sing role(s)?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes, singers will perform 2 roles per year, 1 role per semester.</p>
          <p class="question">At what level in my studies should I be to do this course?</p>
          <p class="answer">This course is for students wanting an immersive training and language experience to help launch them into the auditioning period of their professional beginnings.</p>

          <p class="question">Does the orchestra only work on operatic repertoire?</p>
          <p class="answer">No, there is a large focus on chamber music training and performance as well as individual repertoire for masterclasses and audition preparation.</p>
          <p class="question">What are the lengths of the rehearsals?</p>
          <p class="answer">2.5 hours, 2 times a day</p>
          <p class="question">What kinds of classes are available to orchestra members?</p>
          <p class="answer">German and movement classes are offered five times per week, along with several masterclasses given by local industry-leaders.</p>
          <p class="question">Are there practice rooms?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes, there are 20 practice rooms in one music school and an additional 20 in the other music school available Monday-Saturday for the musicians. </p>

          <p class="question">What does a day look like for apprentices?</p>
          <p class="answer">This entirely depends on the position. Production-based apprentices such as Stage Managers or Assistant Directors are typically focused on staging rehearsals which happen in two blocks a day, each for three hours. There will be preparatory work prior, notes following and miscellaneous tasks interspersed through the week such as prop-sourcing, rehearsal room preparations and score study.</p>
          <p class="question">Who is a great candidate for apprenticeships?</p>
          <p class="answer">Individuals who have study or hobby experience in the area of interest and are looking for more practical experience to add to their repertoire. Some positions require rather advanced training prior to a successful placement such as Assistant Conducting and Repetiteurs. </p>
          <p class="question">Who will I be working with?</p>
          <p class="answer">Apprentices and Interns are either working as part of a team (i.e. Costume, Production, Admin) or directly with one individual (i.e. Conductor, Director, Stage Designer). Faculty changes each year, please email BOA to inquire about your direct contact inquiries.</p>
